Hardware Design of Digital Alarm Clock 

This project was my final lab assignment for ELEC 4200 (Digital System Design).
The purpose of this lab is to come up with and design a complex project that can be implemented
on an FPGA. The project chosen resembles a simple alarm clock with two features: a programmable
digital clock and a programmable alarm system. All code in this report is written with Verilog and
implemented with Vivado 2018.1 and a Nexys A7 board.

ELEC_4200_Final_Proposal.pdf was submitted to faculty before I started the project. It lists the goals, specs, and milestones required to complete the digital alarm clock.

ELEC_4200_Final_Flowchart.png showcases the flowchart used to design the alarm clock. The alarm clock is an FSM consisting of a control unit and datapaths. It handles inputs as a commercial alarm clock would. The alarm clock has five buttons: clock set, alarm set, hour increment, minute increment, and snooze. It has two switches: on/off and alarm on/off.

ELEC_4200_Final_Report explains more of the functionality and the implementation.
